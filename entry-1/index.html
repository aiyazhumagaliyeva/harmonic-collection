 </div>&emsp; <b>WHAT is people-watching?</b>
</div>
  <p> 
    &emsp; People-watching <i>(also known as crowd watching)</i> is the "act of obsering people and their interactions in public"
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp; People-watching can be done through: observing people's body language, attitude, behavior, skills, habits, way of conversation, style, facial features, gestures, posture. 
  </p>
  <div>&emsp;<b>WHY?</b></div>
  <p>
    &emsp; People-watching is something we all do, either aware or unaware of that. Times to times every person has evesdropped or pointed out an especially confusing outfit they saw in the crowd and couldn't let go off. We all people-watch, but none of us remember what we actually see or hear. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &emsp; The purpose of this website is to serve as a comemoration, it is a diary of people. The People-watching Diary
  </p>
  <div>&emsp;<b>WHERE will I be?</b></div>
  <P>
    &emsp; The project will mostly take place in lower Manhattan. Some of the non-Manhattan areas would be Downtown Brooklyn and Williamsburg.
