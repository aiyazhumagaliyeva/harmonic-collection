      People were mostly dressed in comphortable, casual clothing. 
      - Sweatpants, sweatchirt, a hoodie. 
      They mostly looked like they live near by and went on a casual walk in the evening.

      - First group of people was dressed in mostly black. 
        Leather jackets, jeans, black t-shorts and crop tops. emo jewelry
      - Second group of people was dressed in a more of a minimalistic aesthetic.
